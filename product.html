							<p class="about-text text-opacity fs-300 carousel-item-text">
								As one approaches a certain witches cottage on a moonlit night, amidst a barren
								landscape, one can behold a sinister looking confection of immense proportions. From
								afar, the cake looks to be made from a dark and devilish mixture of eerily hued
								concoctions, but as one draws nearer, one can detect the sweet aroma of its
								delectable flavors. The base of this cake is a hearty pumpkiny sponge, for the
								Witches House is known far and wide for its love of all things pumpkin.
							</p>

							<p class="about-text text-opacity fs-300 carousel-item-text">
								Traversing the circumference of this cake is a thick and creamy ganache made with
								butterscotch and dark chocolate. An ornate sugary fence of caramelized marshmallows
								surrounds the perimeter, and lurking within this fence is a bed of chocolate and
								pistachio biscotti that offers texture and crunch. Topping off this cakish terror is
								a bitter dark chocolate frosting and a plethora of spooky decorations, from
								chocolate bats and eerie letters to pieces of chocolate-coated meringue. With such a
								devilishly delightful blend of flavors and decorations, it is no wonder why this
								cake is so popular at Witches House birthday celebrations.
