				<p class="text-opacity fs-300">
					In the outskirts of the quaint and cobblestone-paved village of Oldham, lies a most
					peculiar bakery – for creepier children and adults alike. Long ago, in 1898, Elizabeth
					Weatherwax, an old woman with a profound love of the macabre and supernatural, opened the
					bakery, determined to provide the most delicious and spooky treats in the area. The grand
					old bakery, now passed down from Granny Weatherwax to her five granddaughters, features an
					array of treats inspired by the authors of ages past. From lurking bat cookies, to
					lovecraftian slimes, cupcakes in the shape of ancient tombs, and sinisterly delicious
					birthday cakes, Creepy Cakes for Creepy Children guarantees that guests will leave with a
					sugar fueled excitement. The grand old building is replete with the sounds of laughter and
					the scrumptious aroma of freshly-baked goodies. The walls, adorned with ghoulish
					gargoyles, windy cobwebs, and the likeness of Edgar Allan Poe, are guaranteed to add an
					extra dose of chills to any children's visit. As the sun sets, the children and adults
					alike drift out of the bakery, pleasantly stuffed with delightful treats and memories that
					will last a lifetime. With a cheeky wink, the five granddaughters bid their visitors
					goodbye from the bakery, inviting them to return for a spooktastic time once again.
