					The Weatherwax family had a long history of baking prowess, but no one expected the
					success of their Creepy Cakes bakery. It all began in 1898, when Granny Weatherwax opened
					the bakery with her five granddaughters in tow. The bakery became famous for its eccentric
					cakes, which were designed to look like monstrous creatures and mythical beasts, and the
					unusual flavors made them an instant hit with children.
				</p>

				<p class="text-opacity">
					Rumors spread of strange ingredients coming from the dark corners of the Earth, of
					creatures, ancient artifacts, and powerful magics that went into the cakes. Some said
					Granny Weatherwax had made a deal with eldritch forces to ensure the success of her
					bakery.
				</p>

				<p class="text-opacity">
					Today, Granny Weatherwax and her granddaughters continue to run the Creepy Cakes bakery,
					providing birthday cakes for creepy children all over the world. The bakery's unique
					recipes, strange ingredients, and unusual designs keep the legacy of the Weatherwax family
					alive.
