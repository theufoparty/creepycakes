								Tucked away in the village of Mortshill lies the infamous Creepy Cakes bakery.
								Established in 1920, by the matriarch of the Weatherwax family, Granny Weatherwax,
								it has been harvesting the attention of villagers and neighbouring towns alike ever
								since. The allure of their exquisite bakes has enchanted young and old alike - some
								of whom perhaps found themselves within the doors of the creaky old bakery more than
								once. The uncanny and beguiling Granny Weatherwax, together with her five
								granddaughters, creates an assortment of spooky treats that satisfies all sorts of
								cravings.
							</p>

							<p class="about-text text-opacity fs-300 carousel-item-text">
								From eerie eye and tentacle cupcakes to blood red velvet cakes, each and every one
								of Granny's confections are made with passion and precision, and have all the
								necessary ingredients to tantalise the taste buds. These unearthly treats are no
								doubt the perfect choice for a child's birthday party, especially for those that
								like to revel in the macabre. The sweet-smelling bakery makes sure these scarifying
								treats are drenched in horror and glee; with a sprinkle of terror, for an added
								surprise. The incomparable taste, coupled with the creepier-than-life aesthetic,
								makes Creepy Cakes a must visit for all those in search of something a little
								different. Granny Weatherwax's recipes are a mix of the old and the new, with a
								pinch of old-fashioned terror, making sure her customers' sweet tooth and appetite
