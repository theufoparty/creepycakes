							Creepy Cakes
						</h3>
						<p class="text-opacity fs-300 employee-text">
							In the outskirts of the quaint and cobblestone-paved village of Oldham, lies a most
							peculiar bakery – for creepier children and adults alike. Long ago, in 1898, Elizabeth
							Weatherwax, an old woman with a profound love of the macabre and supernatural, opened
							the bakery, determined to provide the most delicious and spooky treats in the area.
							The grand old bakery, now passed down from Granny Weatherwax to her five
							granddaughters, features an array of treats inspired by the authors of ages past. From
							lurking bat cookies, to lovecraftian slimes, cupcakes in the shape of ancient tombs,
							and sinisterly delicious birthday cakes, Creepy Cakes for Creepy Children guarantees
							that guests will leave with a sugar fueled excitement. The grand old building is
							replete with the sounds of laughter and the scrumptious aroma of freshly-baked
							goodies. The walls, adorned with ghoulish gargoyles, windy cobwebs, and the likeness
							of Edgar Allan Poe, are guaranteed to add an extra dose of chills to any children's
							visit. As the sun sets, the children and adults alike drift out of the bakery,
							pleasantly stuffed with delightful treats and memories that will last a lifetime. With
							a cheeky wink, the five granddaughters bid their visitors goodbye from the bakery,
							inviting them to return for a spooktastic time once again.
