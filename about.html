					The Weatherwax family has been baking cakes for generations, but their most famous cakes
					come from their Victorian bakery. It all began in the late 1800s, when the family
					matriarch Elizabeth Weatherwax decided to start a bakery specializing in eerie-looking
					cakes. She wanted to make cakes that only brave children could enjoy and challenge the
					palate of inquisitive adults. Elizabeth had a passion for creating unique desserts that
					inspired fear and intrigue in clients. Her technique in cake making was soon renowned
					throughout the countryside, and her reputation spread far beyond her home village. Her
					bakery soon became known as "The Creepy Cakery" and became a destination spot for families
					across England and beyond. As word spread of her delicious yet strange treats, local myths
					began to develop around The Creepy Cakery and eventually evolved into a tradition. It was
					said that if you ate one of the creepy cakes blessed by the Weatherwax family then your
					luck would be twice blessed - something none of Elizabeth's satisfied customers seemed to
					dispute! Generations later, the Weatherwax family still holds true to Elizabeth's original
					vision - creating creepy cakes for creepy children! They continue to delight guests with
					innovative bakes like "monster cupcakes" and "ghoulish gourmet cookies". The bakery
					remains a top spot for locals and tourists alike and continues to put smiles on curious
					faces with each bite.
